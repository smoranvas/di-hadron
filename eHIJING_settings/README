after compiling eHIJING, copy the files in this folder into the eHIJING-examples folder.
(I have not enclosed the code for the eHIJING library, since the authors do not want to make
it public until they are ready for that to happen.  However, you can just ask them for it)
Then compile the enclosed executable by running ./compile.sh

Adjust the positions where you want to write files to in run_eHIJING.sh
Then run ./slurm_eHIJING.sh to run multiple jobs on the slurm system for D, C, Fe, and Pb

After this is done, create the pair ntuples for each target by runnning
"python3 parsePairs_ehijing.py /path/to/output/A/\*.dat eA_eHIJING.pkl"
replacing the first argument with the path to the output files of eHIJING
and the second with the name of the output file.  Do this separately
for each target type
